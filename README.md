# Line-Balancing-Instances
Test instances for the assembly line balancing problem

These instances inlcude the following:
  - Number of tasks
  - Cycle (Takt) Time
  - Task Times per model
  - Precedence relations (e.g., 1 2 means task 1 before task 2)
  - Zoning constraints (e.g., 1 7 means task one must be done in zone 7)
  - Forward setup times (e.g., 1 2 113 means that the forward setup time for task 1 to 2 is 113)
  - Backward setup times (similiar to description above)
